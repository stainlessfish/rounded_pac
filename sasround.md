This package contains 2macros:
The first is [roundDec], and the second is [roundSig].

Usage of [roundDec] is as follows
data _null_;
    DUMMY = 123.45;
    VAR1 = %roundDec(trgVal=DUMMY, dec=1);
    VAR2 = %roundDec(trgVal=170, dec=1);
run;

Usage of [roundSig] is as follows
data _null_;
    DUMMY = 1234.56;
    VAR1 = %roundSig(trgVal=DUMMY, sig=3);
    VAR2 = %roundSig(trgVal=0.012345, sig=3);
run;

*   
*   Rounds a numeric variable to the specified number of decimal places and 
*   converts it to a character variable.
*
* PARAMETERS:
*   trgVal     : (Required) The target variable.
*   dec        : (Required) Number of decimal places. 
*
* USAGE:
*   %rounrdDec(trgVal=RES,dec=1);
*
* NOTES:
*   - Only integer values can be assigned to the "dec" parameter. 
*   - For example, if set to "3", "1.234" convert to "1.23".

*
* PARAMETERS:
*   trgVal     : (Required) The target Value.
*   SIG        : (Required) Number of significant digits. 
*
* USAGE:
*   %roundSig(trgVal=RES,Sig=3);
*
